Daniel,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)

- Excellent!

However,

- Please keep your labs private, I don't want others looking at your solutions
  and cheat from your code. Remove them and the submission site will always 
  keep a copy for you.


Peace,
