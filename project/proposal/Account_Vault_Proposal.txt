Password Manager <AccountVault>

My idea for a project would be to implement a password manager style application for Android. It will allow the user to store information pertaining to a particular website/account/service/etc so it would be readily available when needed.

 

Some Items it would store:

Usernames
Passwords
Email Address
Security Questions 
Mothers Maiden Names 
Phone Number 
 

The data will be encrypted using AES and stored in a local database. When the user selects which account they need the information from it will retrieve it from the database and decrypt.
